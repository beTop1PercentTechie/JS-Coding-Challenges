# Welcome to our JavaScript Coding Challenge Sheet! üéâ 

This thoughtfully curated collection is designed to help you strengthen your JavaScript skills, one question at a time. 

We've organized the challenges by topics, making it easy for you to focus on areas that matter most to you. Each category includes multiple questions, and every question comes with a title, description, example, topics covered, helpful hints, and finally, a detailed solution to guide you. 


## Pre-Read Before You Begin:
Please take a moment to carefully go through each question and fully understand the requirements. If you can figure it out, start building the solution confidently. No need to submit your solutions anywhere!

If you're unable to solve the challenge initially:

- Check out the topics covered for a hint or an idea of the approach.
- Explore the helpful resources in the hints section to deepen your understanding.

Make sure to give every challenge at least one try before looking at the solution. 

Once you're done, review the solution and give yourself a well-deserved treat‚Äîwhether for getting the right answer or simply showing up! `Remember, consistent practice will eventually help you crack even the toughest problems.`
